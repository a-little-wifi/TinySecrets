# Tiny secrets

Here is my research with as many technical details about Lenovo's, Dell's, HP's and Acer's small PCs as I can find  
There's some interesting modding opportunities that haven't been explored yet as far as I can tell, and I don't have access to most of the hardware to try it myself

Below is an overview of the different system boards used inside each model, with the shipped vs theoretical maximum potential configuration

See the boardpics directory for high-resolution images of each model's system board, taken from Lenovo's parts webpage

See the riserpics directory for images of each type of PCIe riser I'm aware of

# Random extra notes

* Starting with the Tiny5 generation, the riser slot contains 2 PCIe links, a x8 link from the CPU and a x4 link from the PCH. The PCH link supports hot-plug (don't try it) and is for Thunderbolt support, the CPU link is for GPUs
* On the M90q gen 1 (NM-C901) schematic, the riser slot contains a bunch of extra IO for a supposed BMC card and riser with multiple slots (multiple refclks), possibly meant for unreleased server models?
* The M90q gen 1 schematic also has some extra IO on one of the M-key M.2 slots on the bottom, for some kind of dock-like device. Schematic mentions some special version for internal use at Amazon? Not sure if this is present on other models, no schematic available.
* M70q gen 1 and 2 boards are different from the M90q ones, but look nearly identical except for the CPU VRM config
* I'm not sure what the marketed difference between the M70q gen 3 and 4 and the M80q gen 3 and 4 is since they both support vPro
* Starting with the Tiny6 generation, most boards have unpopulated B-key M.2 WWAN and SIM card slots, might be meant for IoT/Edge/Server versions like the ThinkEdge SE50, but I can't find any other model beyond that one.
* The M90q gen 2 and P350 have an unpopulated footprint for a 3rd M-key M.2 NVMe slot, would be cool to try soldering that on and seeing if it works.

## Schematic observations / potential mods
### Board ID straps
Many of these boards have a set of resistor straps that are used to set the specific SKU of the system, they often share the same board and firmware. At its simplest there is of course the different tiers from the main series, but there's also some interesting options:  
* NEC variants are for the NEC rebranded versions of these systems, setting it reduces the amount of BIOS settings and changes the boot logo to the NEC logo
* Server and Amazon versions in the Tiny6 generation? Neither of these exist publicly as far as I know, I'd love to know more about them.
* Different versions of the M70q and M80q gen 1? (LI and LC)

# In case you wanna help out

I'm always looking for more schematics/boardviews and information about any unique parts, configs, mods and models (non-Lenovo too). If you have or know about anything you think might be of interest here, I'd love to hear about it in an issue on this repo or in my email listed on my profile. Thanks!
